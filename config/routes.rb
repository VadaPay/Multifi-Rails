  # Example of regular route:

  # Example resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  # Example resource route with options:

  #   resources :products do
  #     resources :comments, :sales

  # Example resource route with more complex sub-resources:
  #   resources :products do
